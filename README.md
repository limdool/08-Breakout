# 08-Breakout

Today, I expanded my last assignment, E09a-Scripting. I cloned a respository of the last homework and opend it in Godot. I made some changes. I added an extra ball. When I was adding the second ball, I used the exact same way as the last time of adding the first ball. For example, when I was attaching a script on the second ball, I used a same script that I used for adding the first ball. Next, I changed the background color. For the background, in the Viewport Toolbar, I clicked 'Project,' which is located right side of 'Scene.' In the Project, I clicked 'Project Settings.' In the Project Settings, I clicked 'Environment,' which is located under 'Rendering.' Then, I clicked a bar that is located on the right side of 'Default Clear Color.' After that, I changed the background color into light green. Finally, I ran the game to see if there are any errors. When I ran the game, there were no errors. After running the game, I edited my LICENSE and README.md.
